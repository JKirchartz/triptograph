[Triptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealist_techniques#Triptography) is an automatic photographic technique whereby a roll of film is used three times, causing it to be triple-exposed in such a way that the chances of any single photograph having a clear and definite subject is nearly impossible. This app emulates that technique with images from wikimedia & an automatically generated SVG file.
